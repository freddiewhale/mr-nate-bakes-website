                    <h2>Hi, I'm Nate!</h2>
                    
                    <p>My name is Nathan and I'm 14 years old. I live in Northchurch and go to Ashlyns' school.</p>
                    <p>I started baking when I was five after baking a lemon drizzle cake with my sister and her godmother. It soon became a hobby of mine as it made me feel productive and joyful.</p>
                    <p>A few years later I decided that I should test myself and start up my first business. I wanted to explore catering possibly in the future began to sell to my neighbours on Covert Road. I got lots of repeat orders from multiple people and it gave me confidence to think that I could go further. I decided I should do things properly and gain my Level 2 hygiene certificate as well as an environmental health inspection. Once this was done I started looking at different ways to expand my business and create more buzz around it and I thought that Berkhamsted Market was a good way to start.</p>
                    <p>Leading up to the first one it felt like it was right to think of new ideas for what I could offer to the public. I have seen things like cupcakes done before and it felt right to bring things a bit more different so my initial thought was tray bakes as it is something that is fresh and could possibly come into a very big market in the baking industry so I started making tray bakes in the kitchen after school.</p>
                    <p>Setting up my stall on the first day was something to me which I felt so passionate about - when it was time to start I put on my apron and a smile on my face! I was prepared for my first day and when the first customer came it felt like it was coming together. Then it turned from one to 20 orders and I couldn't believe what was happening in front of my eyes.</p>
                    <p>All I wanted to do was make people happy and have great success on my first day and it was amazing for that to happen.</p>
                    <p>What I like about baking is how it's mindful and it feels nice to do - it also allows you to be creative and the things you can put to mind are unbelievable. If you are thinking about starting to bake I could not recommend it more. You just need to believe in yourself work hard and persevere.</p>
                    <p>It is good to start up with something easy you don't need to think about extravagant things - perfect the simple things and one day you will have all the skills you need to do what would be amazing.</p>
                    <p>Mr Nate Bakes is something that is making me feel so excited for what is to come in the future. I will be forever grateful for all the people that have supported my work as it has given me the confidence to continue with what I'm doing.</p>
